# SAiF-GPT
Project created for AECTech Hackathon 2024 @ Los Angeles.
SAiF-GPT aims to provide a solution for using Chat GPT in a secure and compliant manner, even when dealing with sensitive information. 
To ensure that corporate policies and NDAs are respected, the code and process automate entity detection and anonymization by replacing them with analogous values.
The end goal is to allow AEC industry to use AI technology like ChatGPT for document analysis while protecting confidential data.
